# MLFlow CDK Demo

This project is a slightly different version of [this](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-mlflow-fargate/tree/main) for the purposes of getting something up and running for a simple MLFlow demo.

## Useful CDK commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
